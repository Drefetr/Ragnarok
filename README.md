# Ragnarok

Ragnarok, an Oxide mod. for the Rust Dedicated Server. A hellscape attempt: Shitty weather, and a constant barrage of meteors --

Which can be configured to spawn loose resources, resource nodes, neither or both.

I highly recommend using the Cornucopia mod. (http://oxidemod.org/plugins/cornucopia.1264) to control clean-up of the spawned resource node(s).
